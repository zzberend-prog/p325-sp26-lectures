This is the *function definition*, which tells Python the anme of the function and what kind of information the function needs to do its job. In this case, the name of the function is `fahrenheit_to_celcius` and it needs the variable `degrees_f` to do its job. Finally, the definition ends in a colon (`:`).\n",
