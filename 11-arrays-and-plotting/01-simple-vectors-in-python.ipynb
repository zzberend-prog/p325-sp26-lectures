    "# Arrays and Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Many operations in the physical sciences involve vectors, which are generally used to succinctly summarize information about anything that has a magniutde and a direction. For example, the velocity of a car has a magnitude (speed) and direction, as does the acceleration. We will use the `array` data type from the `numpy` module to work with vectors. Because plotting helps visualize what vectors actually represent, we'll make figures using the `matplotlib` module.\n",

    "A visual representation of a vector $(x,y)$ is an arrow that goes from the origin $(0,0)$ to the given $(x,y)$ point. This is true for any number of dimensions. Given two such vectors, $(u_1, u_2)$ and $(v_1, v_2)$, we can add them according to the rule:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(u_1, u_2) + (v_1, v_2) = (u_1 + u_2, v_1 + v_2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Subtraction is done in a similar way. You can also multiple vectors by a number. This number, called $a$ below, is usually denoted as a *scalar*:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a \\cdot (v_1, v_2) = (a v_1, a v_2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The inner product, also called a dot product, or scalar product, of the two vectors is a number:\n",

    "We will use the `array` object to represent vectors. They can be viewed as a variant of a list, but with the following assumptions and features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All elements must be of the same type, preferably `int`, `float`, or `complex`, for efficient numerical computing and storage.\n",
    "- The number of elements must be known when the array is created.\n",
    "- Arrays are not part of standard Python; instead we will use `numpy`.\n",
    "- Arrays with one index are often called vectors.\n",
    "- Arrays with two indices are used as an efficient data structure for tables, instead of lists of lists. They are also often referred to as matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two caveats to the above:\n",
    "1) There is a an object type called `array` in Python, but this data type is not so efficient so we will ignore it.\n",
    "2) The number of elements in an array *can* be changed, but at a substantial computing cost.\n",
