    "## Avoiding Indentation Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation to determine how a line, or group of lines, is related to the rest of the program. This generally makes Python code very easy to read, for two reasons:\n",
    "1. It uses whitespace to force you to write neatly formatted code,\n",
    "2. It provides a clear visual structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you being to write code that relies on proper indentation, you'll need to watch out for *indentation errors*. For example, you might indent lines of code that don't need to be indented, or forget to indent lines that do need to be indented. Let's look at a few examples so you can avoid them in the future, or easily recognize them if they do pop up.\n",
