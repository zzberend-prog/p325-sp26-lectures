    "# Working With Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section you learned how to make a list and work with individual elements. In this chapter, you'll learn how to easily loop through an entire list. *Looping* allows you to take the same action (or set of actions) with every element in a list. This will make it dramatically easier analyze a list containing the data that you're interested in.\n",

    "## Looping Through an Entire List\n",
    "\n",
    "You will often want to run through all entries in a list and perform the same action to each item. For example, you may want to loop over a list of temperatures in Celcius and convert all of them to Ferenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a list of numbers representing a range of temperatures in Celcius and we want to print out each temperature in the list. We could do this by retrieving each number in the list individually, but this approach could cause several problems. For one, it would be repetitive to do this with a long list of names. Also, we would have to change our code each time the list changed!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can use a `for` loop and avoid both of these issues by letting Python handle them internally. Below is an example that prints all the numbers in a list:"

    "Looping is one of the most common ways a computer automates repetitive tasks. In the example above, it retrieved the first value from the list (`-10`), associated with the variable `temp`, and then printed it. Then it read the next value in the list (`0`), associated it with the variable `temp`, and printed it. It continues doing this until there are no more items in the list, and then moves to the next line.\n",
