    "# Working With Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're more familiar with lists and the need for indentation, it's a good time to talk about styling your code to avoid syntax errors and make it more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Styling Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Style Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "When proposing changes to Python, people make a *Python Enhancement Proposal*, or PEP. One of the oldest is PEP 8, which is about how to style code. It's quite long, so we'll stick with the simple stuff that's relevant to what we're currently learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The style guide was written with the understanding that **code is read more often than it is written**. You'll write your code once and then start reading it as you begin debugging. When you come back later to add more features, you'll begin by reading what is already there. When you share your code with someone, they will read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, your goal should be to write code that is easier to read instead of code that is easier to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The PEP 8 recommendation is four spaces per indentation level. We've already seen that VS Code defaults to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In word processing documents, people often use tabs instead of spaces. This works fine in word processing documents, but the Python interpreter gets confused when tabs are mixed with spaces. Every text editor provides a setting that lets you use the TAB key but then coverts each tab to a set number of spaces. Whenever you use a new editor, be sure to check that it is setup to insert spaces rather than tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixing tabs and spaces in your file can cause problems that are very difficult to diagnose. Everything just looks like white space to you, but Python can tell the difference. If you think you have a mix of tabs and spaces, you can convert all tabs in a file to spaces in most editors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Line Length\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Python programmers recommend that each line should be less than 80 characters. This was originally because early computers could only fit 79 characters on a single line on their screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, developers often have multiple programs open side-by-side. Keeping lines to a maximum length allows you to do this without any lines wrapping around, which hampers readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PEP 8 guidelines recommend that you follow this guideline, with the additional suggestion that commented lines are no longer than 72 characters. (This is because some tools that generate documentation add a few extra characters to the beginning of the line.)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the PEP 8 guidelines for line length are not set in stone. Some people prefer a 99-character limit, since screens are much wider and it can sometimes be challenging to keep your code to 79 characters or less. For now, keep this in mind, but don't worry too much if a line or two of your code is longer than this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blank Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "To group parts of your program visually, use blank lines. However, you should be careful not to do this excessively. If you put a blank line between every line of code, it defeats the purpose of grouping! I will try to show good eamples of code grouping as we go over new topics in lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean up the example code inspired by homework 2 that verifies the two equations:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\\\\n",
    "(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for two different pairs of $a$ and $b$. Add useful comments where appropriate."
