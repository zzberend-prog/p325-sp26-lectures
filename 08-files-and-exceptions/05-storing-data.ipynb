    "Many of your programs will need to save numbers, lists, or other objects to a file in addition to text. There are two general methods for this: `json` and Python's built-in `pickle` functionality.\n",

    "The `json` module allows you to conert simple Python data structures into JSON-formatted strings, and the load the data from that file the next time the program runs.  The benefit is that the resulting file is human readable and portable across programming languages. The downside is that the files are larger, slower to read, and limited to basic data types like `str`, `float`, `int`, `list`, and a few others.\n",

    "The `pickle` module is built into Python and stores information in a binary file. This results in smaller files, faster read times, and support for most Python data types. However, it is not human readable and is Python specific, which potentially limits who you can share the files with."
