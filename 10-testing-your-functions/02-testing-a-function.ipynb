    "# Testing Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In this directory is a Python program `trapezoids.py` that we'll be testing today. It contains two functions: `trapezint1()` and `trapezint()` that should be familiar from the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll automate the testing of these functions with `pytest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit Tests and Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest kinds of tests you can write is a unit test. A *unit test* verifies that one specific aspect of a functions behavior is correct. A *test case* is a collection of unit tests that together prove that a function is doing what it's supposed to, within the full range of situations you expect it to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good test case considers all the possible kinds of input a function could receive and includes tests to represent each of those situations. A test case with *full coverage* includes a full range of unit tests covering all the possible ways you expect the function to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For us, testing all the functions and ranges that might be integrated with the trapezoid function is a daunting, and likely impossible, task. It's often good enough to write tests for your code's cticial behaviors. If you notice a bug later, you can add an additional test at that time to make sure it doesn't sneak back into your program in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A passing test\n",
    "\n",
    "To test our function, we'll write a test function and make an assertion about what the output should be. If our assertion is correct, the test will pass; if the assertion is incorrect, the test will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a program named `test_trapezoids.py` in the same directory as `trapezoids.py`, and include the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from trapezoids import trapezint1\n",
    "\n",
    "def step(x):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Simple function that equals 1 between [0,1] and 0 otherwise\"\"\"\n",
    "    if 0 <= x <= 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    return 0\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_trapezint1_step01():\n",
    "    \"\"\"Can we integrate a step function from 0 to 1 with one trapezoid?\"\"\"\n",
    "    result = trapezint1(step, 0, 1)\n",
    "    assert result == 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The name of a test file is important; it must start with *test_*. When we ask `pytest` to run the tests we've written, it will look for any file that begins with *test_*, and run over all the tests it finds in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the test file, we started by importing the function we want to test, `trapezint1()`. Then we defined a function we will integrate (`step()`), and finally a test function: `test_trapezint1_step01()`. Any function that starts with `test_` will be *discovered* by `pytest`, and will be run as part of the testing process. Since we'll be making many test cases, the function name also includes enough description to make it unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the test function, we call the function we're testing and store the result. Finally, we make an assertion. An *assertion* is a claim about a condition. Here we're claiming that the integral of our step function from 0 to 1 should be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running a test\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the program `test_trapezoids.py` directly, you won't get any output because we never called the test function. Instead, we'll have `pytest` run the test file for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, open a terminal window in VS code and navigate to the folder that contains the test file. For us, that will look like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd 10-testing-your-functions\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, enter the command `pytest` in the terminal. The first thing we see is information about the system the test is running on, as well as the version of Python and other modules that are being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we see the directory where the test is being run from, and the tests that were found (and run) in this directory. The single dot after `trapezoids.py` indcates that one test was found, and the 100% makes it clear that all tests have passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final line summarizes how many tests there were and how long it took to run them all. For now, our `trapezoids` module seems to be in good shape. If we ever update the code, we can run this test again to make sure it still works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Failing Test\n",
    "\n",
    "What does a failing test look like? Let's update the `trapezint()` function so that the user can pass the value of `n` via a function argument. (Hard coding it to `n=4` seem a bit arbitrary, doesn't it?) Now run `pytest` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, we get a single `F` after the test, indicating that 100% of the tests have failed. It also points out the specific test that failed and points out which lined contains the problem. Here, we updated the code, but didn't update the test, so it fails because our function cass is missing 1 required positional argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Responding to a Failed Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you're checking the right condition, a passing test means the function is behaving correctly, and a failing test indicates there is an error in the new code you wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, if your code was working properly before, you don't want to immediately update the test. Instead, look at the changes and understand how it affects someone already using your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the addition of a mandatory `n` parameter broke the original behavior of the `trapezint()` function. Here, a good option might be to make the `n` parameter optional by assigning it a default, to avoid breaking previously working code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, after you've shared code you should be careful about changing the default behavior. If you think it's well motivated, you will want to make this obvious to any users, often by changing the primary version number. For example, when Python changed how the `print()` function worked (among other things) they changed from Python 2.7 to Python 3.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the code so that the number of trapezoids is optional with a default value `n=4` and run `pytest` again."

    "## Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add more tests of the trapezoid code. Let's start by integrating the hat function from \\[0,1\\] instead of \\[0,4\\]. Add a second function to the `test_trapzoids.py` program:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_trapezint_hat01():\n",
    "    \"\"\"Can we integrate a step function from 0 to 1 with one trapezoid?\"\"\"\n",
    "    result = trapezint1(step, 0, 1)\n",
    "    assert result == 0.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "Why does the test fail? Can you look through the code to understand what's going wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, add a test to integrate $f(x) = \\sin{x}$ from $[0,\\pi]$ using two trapezoids. The exact answer is 2. Is this the value that you should check in your test? Since using the `==` operator is dangerous for floating-point numbers, can you change the `assert` statement to check a conditional statement that checks if they answer is within `1e-5` of the expected answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Take aways:\n",
    "- Achieving full coverage with your tests can be tricky, especially with numerical methods. It's best to write tests that explore multiple aspects of the algorithm.\n",
    "- You are testing the expected result of the **function**; for numerical methods, that means you may not be asserting the result is equal to the analytic result. Rather, you're checking that the approximation is behaving as expected."
