    "* Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. For instance, you can call a variable `message_1` but not `1_message`. However, `one_message` is just fine.\n",
    "* Spaces are **not** allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names. For example, `greeting_message` works, but `greeting message` will cause errors.\n",
    "* Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names. For example, don't use the word `print` as a variable name.\n",
    "* Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, `number` is better than `n`, and `name_length` is better than `length_of_a_persons_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For now, using lowercase letters is best. Using uppercase letters won't cause an error, but their use in variable names has a special meaning that we'll get to later. Also keep in mind that Python is case sensitive, so `var` and `VAR` are two different variables.\n"
